#Introduction:
“SKY RUN” is an epic endless adventurous running game where the player takes the role of a young man who has to drive a air vehicle through the sky a place full of viruses and bacterias, collecting coins and dodging obstacles by sliding unless he collides with the obstacles. It is a single player 2D game where the obstacles  can be still or animated.  Collecting coins and driving the vehicle will score points for the player. The goal is  to survive as long as possible in the game and score as much as possible. For graphical interference,  SDL2 libraries have been used and code has been written in C/C++ language.
